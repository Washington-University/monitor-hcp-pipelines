CheckPackageExistence
=====================

# Description

The CheckPackageExistence.sh script performs checks to determine whether 
appropriate package files exist for a specified subject.

It currently only checks for the existence of Structural, Functional, and Diffusion
preprocessed data packages.  It does not check for the existence of ICA FIX or
Task Analysis packages.

It was written to check the package creation process that was added to the end of
the XNAT pipelines for the 500 Subject release of [Human Connectome Project][HCP] 
data.
